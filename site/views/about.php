        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <h4>Education:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>BSc (Hons.) Computer Science at Loughborough University, 1st class, graduated 2008.
            <li>A-Levels in Physics, Maths and Computing, all grade B.

        <h4>Interests:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Programming</b> - I enjoy writing code and playing around with new technologies in my spare time. I have recently been investigating the Nginx web server as an alternative to Apache, and I have been working with components from the Symfony2 PHP framework to replace my custom MVC implementation. A selection of my projects is available on my GitHub page.</li>
            <li><b>Playing video games</b> - I am a huge fan of video games, with my favourite genres being racing and RPGs, although I enjoy anything that I can play with friends, either cooperatively or competitively.</li>
            <li><b>Driving</b> - I love cars and I love driving. In recent years, I have been to a number of track day events, as well as a stunt-driving course. I am looking forward to attending an off-road driving class later this year.</li>
            <li><b>Playing guitar</b> - I am attempting to teach myself to play guitar. It's slow-going, but I am getting a lot of satisfaction from experimenting and picking things up as I go along.</li>
            <li><b>Films</b> - I'm no film critic, I just like being entertained. </li>
        </ul>
